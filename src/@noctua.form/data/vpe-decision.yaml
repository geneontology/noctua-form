definitions:
  activityActivityRelationship:
    regulation:
      id: activityActivityRelationship:regulation
      label: Regulation
      description: The upstream activity conditionally controls the downstream activity
    constitutivelyUpstream:
      id: activityActivityRelationship:constitutivelyUpstream
      label: Constitutively Upstream
      description:
        The upstream activity is normally present and required for the
        downstream activity.
    providesInputFor:
      id: activityActivityRelationship:providesInputFor
      label: Provides Input For
      description:
        The upstream activity produces a molecule that is an input for
        the downstream activity.
    removesInputFor:
      id: activityActivityRelationship:removesInputFor
      label: Removes Input For
      description:
        The upstream and downstream activities have the same input but
        the upstream activity makes the input unavailable for the downstream activity.
    undetermined:
      id: activityActivityRelationship:undetermined
      label: Undetermined
      description: There is insufficient data to specify a precise causal mechanism.
  activityMoleculeRelationship:
    product:
      id: activityMoleculeRelationship:product
      label: Product
      description: The activity creates the molecule as a reaction product

    regulates:
      id: moleculeActivityActivityRelationship:regulates
      label: Regulation
      description: The chemical regulates the activity
    substrate:
      id: moleculeActivityActivityRelationship:substrate
      label: Substrate
      description: The chemical is the substrate that the activity acts upon
  effectDirection:

  directness:
    direct:
      id: directness:direct
      label: Direct
      description: The upstream activity immediately precedes the downstream activity
    indirect:
      id: directness:indirect
      label: Indirect
      description:
        There are intervening activities between the upstream and downstream
        activities.

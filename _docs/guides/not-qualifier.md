# NOT Qualifier

## Adding a NOT qualifier to nn Annotation

In some cases, GO annotations may need to be qualified with a ‘NOT’ qualifier.

To add a ‘NOT’ qualifier to an annotation in the Noctua form, first select the ‘more options’ menu.

Select ‘NOT’ qualifier from the menu.

The resulting annotation will now have a label ‘IS NOT’ in the form and will be output with the ‘NOT’ qualifier in the derived GPAD file.

Note that it is not possible to add the ‘NOT’ qualifier to contextual information

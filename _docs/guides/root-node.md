# Root Node Annotation

## Adding a root node Annotation

Root node annotations can be readily added using the Noctua form.

To add a root node annotation, first select the version of the form (Activity Unit, BP only, CC only) you wish to use.

Click on the ‘more options’ menu, select the ‘Easy Fill’ option, and then ‘Add Root Term Value’.

The resulting root term, with appropriate evidence (ND evidence code and GO_REF:0000015) will automatically be added to the form.

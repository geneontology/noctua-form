# Authentication 

## Login

Before beginning new annotation or work on an existing model, you need to login.

Noctua login uses a curatorâ€™s github handle for authentication.


GO-CAM models may be viewed without logging in to Noctua Form, but if you wish to create new annotations or make edits to a model, you must be logged in.
To log in, click on the Login button in the upper right corner, and on the resulting page click on "Sign in with Github." When you are signed in, press the "Return" button to return to the Noctua landing page.

				  Add new decision.  If NO, go to catalytic activity question, if YES, create model as described below.

Question: "Does the causal effect depend on another process? (for example, transcription factor activity depends on transcription occurring)."

No is selected by default. 

If yes is selected show a drop-down menu with:
- choose process [this is the default]
- transcription, DNA templated (GO:0006351)
- ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO:0006511)
- receptor internalization (GO:0031623)
- nuclear import (GO:0051170)

If YES is chosen, when the CREATE button is chosen, make the selected BP instance, and connect it to both the upstream MF and downstream MF:
[upstream MF] - pos/neg regulates -> [BP] -pos/neg regulates [downstream MF]

r1 r2
if transcription / nuclear import 
r2 = positively regulates
else 
r2 = negatively regulates



This should not be a decision point, but replace with output:
[upstream MF] -directly pos/neg regulates-> [downstream MF]
